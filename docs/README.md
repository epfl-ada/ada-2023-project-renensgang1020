# Global Brews, Local Views: Decoding the World's Beer Preferences

## üçª **Introduction**

In an era where globalization blends tastes and traditions, beer remains a distinctive symbol of cultural identity and preference. "Global Brews, Local Views" is a deep dive into the effervescent world of beer reviews, where each sip and each rating tells a story not just about the beer, but also about the reviewer. This project is a journey into understanding how personal biases, cultural backgrounds, and national pride shape our perceptions and ratings of beers from around the globe.

## üåç **The Essence of Our Exploration**

Our mission is to uncork the hidden dynamics in beer ratings, analyzing how a reviewer's personal preferences, their nationality, and their beer review history might skew their ratings. We're not just studying beers; we're exploring how people's backgrounds and biases influence their taste.

## üîç **Structure and Scope of the Journal**

1. **Unveiling Beer Nations**: We will start by mapping out the beer landscape, identifying countries with high average ratings, and understanding how different aspects like taste and appearance contribute to these ratings. This section will also explore if there's a correlation between a country's beer diversity and its ratings.

2. **International Beer Relations (IBR)**: Here, we will examine the global influence of beers. Which countries' beers are most celebrated abroad? Is there evidence of mutual beer admiration between certain nations? This section aims to unravel the diplomatic ties in the beer world.

3. **Bias in Beer Reviews**: The final section will delve into the psychology of beer reviewers. Are some reviewers consistently more generous or harsh? We will attempt to adjust for these biases and re-evaluate our earlier findings to see if the landscape of beer nations shifts.

## üìù **Progress and Reflections**: 
This journal will document our progress, challenges, and discoveries. It will be a living record of our exploration into the world of beer ratings, reflecting not only what we learn about beer but also about human nature. Each section will be underpinned by rigorous data analysis. We'll use statistical tools to dissect and interpret the data, ensuring our insights are as robust as they are intriguing.

So, let's raise our glasses to a journey of discovery, where data meets draughts, and insights flow as freely as ale. Welcome to "Global Brews, Local Views"! üç∫

## Question 1: Where are the Beer Nations?

### üìö **Understanding the Data**

#### **The Source**
Our journey into the world of beer ratings begins with the data sourced from RateBeer, an American website celebrated for its comprehensive and accurate information on beer. RateBeer has established itself as a pivotal online community for craft beer enthusiasts, focusing on beer education and unbiased ratings.

#### **Rating Dynamics**
On RateBeer, users can rate beers across four key aspects: appearance, aroma, palate, and taste. Additionally, they can provide textual reviews to share their nuanced opinions. Crucially, users can also disclose their country of origin, offering us a valuable dimension for analysis.

### üåæ **Sifting Through the Data**

#### **User Participation**
A preliminary glance reveals a range of user engagement levels. Many users leave only one or a handful of ratings. For our analysis, particularly in identifying favorite beer styles per country, these sporadic ratings offer limited insight.

#### **Threshold for Inclusion**
To ensure meaningful and reliable conclusions, we adopt a dual threshold approach. Users with fewer than eight ratings and countries represented by fewer than ten users are filtered out. This balance between data abundance and quality is crucial for our analysis.

### üåç **Examining the Remaining Countries**

#### **Diverse Participation**
Post-filtration, we're left with a globally diverse set of countries, each with a significant user base contributing to the beer ratings. This allows us to delve into the data with confidence, knowing that our insights will be representative of a broader spectrum of beer enthusiasts.

#### **Upcoming Analyses**
Our next steps involve deep dives into understanding the favorite beer styles in these countries, exploring regional preferences, and uncovering global trends. We aim to paint a picture not just of the beers themselves, but of the cultural and personal preferences that shape the world's beer landscape.

### üç∫ **A Toast to Data-Driven Insights**
This initial stage sets the groundwork for our exploration into the "Beer Nations." It's a celebration of diversity, both in beer styles and in the global community of those who love them. Let's raise our glasses to the insights awaiting us in the pages ahead!
